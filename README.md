Determinants of Housing Prices in the Secondary Market in Poland
Overview
This project analyzes the factors influencing housing prices in the secondary market across major Polish cities. Using an econometric approach, I have developed a linear regression model to identify key determinants of housing prices. The analysis is based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle, covering housing sales from August to December 2023.

Key Findings
Size and Condition: Larger apartments and those in better condition tend to have higher prices.
Proximity to Amenities: Closer proximity to schools, clinics, and restaurants is associated with higher housing prices.
Building Material: Apartments built with brick are generally more expensive.
Location: Housing prices in Warsaw are significantly higher than in other cities.
Data
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and includes housing sales data from 15 major cities in Poland. The final dataset consists of 2,094 observations, with variables such as price, square meters, number of rooms, and distances to various amenities.

Model
The analysis was conducted using a classic linear regression model. Diagnostic tests were performed to ensure the validity of the model, and a robust variance-covariance matrix was applied to address heteroskedasticity.

Conclusion
The study provides insights into the key factors that influence housing prices in Poland’s secondary market. While the model explains a significant portion of price variability, further research could refine the analysis by including more interactions or conducting city-specific studies.
