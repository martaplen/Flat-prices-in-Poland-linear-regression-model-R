# Determinants of Housing Prices in the Secondary Market in Poland
## Overview
> This project analyzes factors affecting housing prices in the secondary market across major Polish cities. Using an econometric approach, I have developed a linear regression model to identify key determinants of housing prices. The analysis is based on a dataset sourced from Kaggle (created by Krzysztof Jamroz), covering housing sales from August to December 2023.

## Contents
* __Introduction:__ A brief overview of the study and its significance.
* __Literature Review:__ Summary of key studies and their contributions to understanding housing prices.
* __Hypothese:__ The main hypotheses tested in the analysis.
* __Data Description:__ Information about the dataset used, including its sources and key variables.
* __Model Estimation:__ Details on the regression models used and the diagnostic tests performed.
* __Results Interpretation:__ A summary of the findings and their implications.
* __Hypotheses Verification:__ Evaluation of the hypotheses based on the model results.
* __Conclusion:__ Final thoughts and potential areas for further research.

## Key Findings
1. ___Size and Condition:___ Larger apartments and those in better condition tend to have higher prices.
2. ___Proximity to Amenities:___ Closer proximity to schools, clinics, and restaurants is associated with higher housing prices.
3. ___Building Material:___ Apartments built with brick (higher quality material) are generally more expensive. 
4. ___Location:___ Housing prices in Warsaw are significantly higher than in other cities.

### Data
The dataset was sourced from __Kaggle__ and includes housing sales data from 15 major cities in Poland. The final dataset consists of __2,094 observations__, with variables such as price, square meters, number of rooms, and distances to various amenities.

### Model
The analysis was conducted using a __classic linear regression model__. Diagnostic tests were performed to ensure the validity of the model, and a robust variance-covariance matrix was applied to address heteroskedasticity.

### Conclusion
The study provides insights into the key factors that influence housing prices in Poland’s secondary market. While the model explains a significant portion of price variability, further research could refine the analysis by including more interactions or conducting city-specific studies.
